Ravenous is an App as part of the study with Codecademy, which serves only for the purpose of study.

Hereâ€™s an overview of how Ravenous should function:

As a user, I should be able to search for restaurants
As a user, I should be able to view a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API
As a user, I should be able to sort through restaurants using a filter

The goal the project is to build a Yelp-like App.
